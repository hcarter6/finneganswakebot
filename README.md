# Finnegans Wake GPT Twitter Bot

This is a Twitter bot that tweets excerpts from text generated by a 355-million parameter GPT-2 language model trained on the full text of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake.

This repository was cloned from https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/twitter-bot-python-aws-lambda. I added gpt2_textgen.py (adapted from https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple) and the Finnegans Wake files in src; the rest is mostly unchanged. I got the idea from similar twitter accounts: https://twitter.com/GravitysBot
