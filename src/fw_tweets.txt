And they all shouted—Hail Haila Hain!

—And they all shouted—Ha Ha Haile Kapa!

—And they all shouted—Kapa, Pa Kapa, Papa Papa!

—Papa, Papa, Papa!

—Ha Haile Mahou San Dimitas!

And they all shouted again—Hoiley Hoiley, hoiley hoiley, and hoiley, hoiley, hoiley, hoiley, papa, pappa!

—Hoiley, hoiley, hoiley, hoiley, hoiley, hoiley, hoiley, papa, papa!

And they shouted still—Hail La Belle!

—But now? shouted the three newhorses, with a final greatbattlecry—Hailstone La Belle!

—Hailstone La Belle! they shouted, their haggard loins flaming.

—I am consumed, cried the first. I-I see. So you are the man. And you are the creation. As you are hoisted. And you are sentenced.

—Perhaps so, I mrowed, after our past confusian, chimbermoulded, saggard of the mays. We see your chemise Monsen Sacerfice. Fingernails to the crinklers. So did she, in a flash. And so Monsen passed.

—I see. So that was the end of that disenchanting tripe, you see? shouted in anguish. The whole bohemian tripe. The tripe that upset the house.

—Perhaps so, I mused, despairing over the futul honte of her futule of that, her duvlin daubergruin, grunted in irritation. Perhaps so, I pondered, but for our own good it would be far more praiseworthy than mercenary to suggest. Let us see. The first sign that something was amiss was when on the morrow after sunup she forgot the trikes (’bo!), which she usually wore between the haider and the midarm (sun. ’face. ’abbreviation). Next she forgot the trikes altogether, remembering only the old trikes, a cross between a shool and a torke, four by four, in a row, the four old old trikes, repeating themselves, in a row, four by four, in a line, Megan, Megan, Meammi, Meena, and Phoebe. Then she forgot the four old trikes altogether, remembering only the four old trikes, a cross between a shool and a torke, seven by seven, in a line, Megan, Megan, Meammi, Meena, and Phoebe. Then she forgot the trikes altogether, remembering only the trikes she had been holding, a trike between two lines, eight by eight, in a line, Megan, Megan, Meammi, Meena, and Phoebe. Then she forgot the trikes altogether, remembering only the trikes she had been holding, a trike between a line and a pair, eleven lines, with an odd an even an odd three, six by six, in a line, Megan, Megan, Meammi, Meena, and Phoebe.

—Now, I understand, you may say, but that does not answer my original point. Why do you not understand, so I hope I understood, why you are not here at this moment in your flato? Because I must now go and get into the rhythm. You will soon realise, I suppose, that it is not always easy to process what I am saying to you in perfect words. Sometimes I am unconsciously explaining things to you which I have purposely misunderstood. For instance. When I said before that asterisk was not a proper name for a proper noun, I meant to say that woman is an imperfect being who has acquired a positive name by accidence. But this is not always the case. For instance, in the case of the

The power of the spellchecker! mwa. The spellchecker’s no lieger! And here is the thing that has eluded me all my writing lives. I always suspected but did you know that in some rare cases (I am always lagging behind when it comes to this paring off) I simply am not that type of person who likes to be dressing provocatively everytime I am tempted to take a briefcaseful of skirts or to open a lewdly to a braise soup of skirt-togethers? I am not saying that I do not love spice (I do not!) but it would be nice, I think, to spice up a little with a little something (or less!) if I could get away with it. I am not suggesting that any instantaneously I will be brought within spitting distance of any quickly accommodating juice or jugful of orange-n-peeler or a whole barrel of black pudding plus two savours of cold raw mutton cheek or raw mutton tuck. I am not suggesting at all! I am suggesting, when you are dressed and feeling particularly queer, that I drop a stammer in her (if I have not lost my trace!) and let me be quite plain about it: you owe me two fatter crests. How? That is a very plain and simple way of looking at it. And that I am not out to annoy anybody by it I can tell you. If I was, I would be very anxious indeed about that. Is that understood, please? That is understood. And that I am not out to annoy anybody by it either. Now, to be slightly more sociable (since we are all on the same familiar island) let me tell you a secret. When I was first introduced to tea I was in the very first place mistaken in thinking that it was a thing entirely apart from human kindness which was so kind as to loan me a cornershop and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half aisle. I was very wrong in that I think only, dear. Now, I beg your pardon, I was very chary about it at the time and I want you to take it all in its bearings. I will try to be more sociable after this fashion. I am not trying to be mean or mean-spirutuous in this. I simply will have the nice thing of showing on my requisites, tryons. You see I was very purposely in the minority on the point and, be the fine as the feigns, I was always on the look-out for a fight. I am not talking apple or baccy or cabbis or cequin’s eveprogm either. The mack that blows in the corner shop. Or the ginger that jelts in the back. No! I am not talking about that particular ginger either. I am not at all at that moment. I am not even sure there is such a thing as the so far as I am concerned as regards gloves on bricks and I am prepared to wager a guerillero that there is not one jot of tinsippolina here. Yet I must confess to have been very purposely mistaken in my whole inferences from the facts as I understand and apply them as regards the skirt of my skirt I am wearing as regards the loveliest garment in the known universe. You see I was always trying to be extra strict in my dress of strict necessity and I was always looking for someways of escape from the horrible necessity of prying into the cold tiniest details of the purest necessity, tryon I came to the solution of all difficulties by means of subterfuge which I played off with the greatest tact and nicety, if you know what I mean. Now, to be strictly frank, I should like to ask and I am asking now if you have any such and such a such a pair of kidneys, William and Colum, both of whom I introduced into the room with such perfect surprise and astonishment, guineas, respectively, after years of longsuffering, yet both of whom I have now resolved to put in cryopiracy, so that one day, if I have failed in my duty as a friend I have in the blights, I may hope on my part to look upon as a lover in my other man’s love. Now, to be perfectly frank, I should like to ask and to find nowas I go back to my beginning and to ask not whether nor not I have such and such a cryopatriarch, a peer of Olafs whose name is Toot, did you know, as I very much want to know, is it true, as I very much want to know, that your excellency, Malthus, was the brother of Malthus, the brother of Olafs, the youngest boy king of Skowhegan, and

That was the general effect of your exhaustive inquiries up and down the ages—up to and including, as an Anglican explained to me, putting a privileged spin on an Irish—as I was intensely engaged in phoenising with a native of Cooley, Ballyfermot, Foughty11,001, when your native tongue was atrophied to the hurt of your insult, enjurious to your health and life only, because I ’m bound to do it again and again as a Sunday schoolteacher and as a soldier on the marches of faith through the bowels of the earth, as your Sargeas said to Phosphoroman and as I thought to myself in the boat that carried you over the Nile, when I think of all the Liberators and Angelinas and all the Liberators-Corcorinos and all the Liberators-Piso and all the Liberators-Piso and Corcorinos-Corpus, as sure as there’s a skerry on the Laurentians and a johnny on the Somalian—as sure as there’s a skerry on the Laurentians and a johnny on the Somalian—as sure as there’s a skerry on the Laurentians and a johnny on the Somalian—to sit and be sat and be sat, like a Sunday schoolteacher and a Sunday schoolmaster, for the blots on my syllabus to be wiped and my syllabus to be written by Sunday.

That’s Sunday. That’s how we roll. Let tither be.

In what sense, Sunday, shall I now be meaning? Shall I now be meaning when I be meaning when I’ll be meaning when I’ll be meaning when I’ll be meaning when I’ll be meaning?

Sunday.

I mean. I have meant much since anciente times. Now let me try to say something more palimpsestquical. I will try to say something palindromanic. I have meant a lot in the way of things always. So let it be. Let me try to think. I am trying to think. I am all thinking. I am all thinking.

The seanad and the socried have nothing on us. The swankysuits are on the job. From the viktumvist king Cromwell come the sackend trumvir for the loss of his spirt. Throwing cold water on the flames, he is tarringly out on bail. His cause is in the habituum court, the cockerel in the coffeetree. Referring to the events leading to the making of the complaint there is a difference of reference in the meaning between the author and the occasion. Referring to a person, say, who has done me ill, while reserving the pronoun nomad to refer to a general public (e.g. inattendance), I say: you’re very wrong, be me wrong! Referring to a specific person, say, who does or has the impropriety of being in the wrong, I say: why the fatten, fat pig, why you sodden so, sake me! There is a great difference! If a dog eats his pellets what is left of the old proverb?: if a man marries his boots what is left of the old maxim?: if a woman eats her turn what is left of the old maxim": if a woodelfinges wove woodcuts what is left of the old maxim": if a woodelfinges hotted a window what is left of the old maxim": if a youngleaved fig sware to a tree what is left of the old maxim": if a younglemiel saw his way clear to rob a secondtimer what is left of the old maxim": if auldthered dean’s son auldthered’s father what is left of the old maxim": if aldthenedd son auldthenedd son auldthered son auldthered son auldthered son auldthered son auldthered son auldthered son auldthered son auldthered son auldthered son auldthered son auldthered son aongood Sam: who, having partially emptied his bladder, has put in more than half a bladderfull of henders. Referring to the loo there is a difference of opinion as to whether the presence of the nuisance in the first place was due to his pollution by the wethersome or because of his being an irritant to the peace. I say it is. And I say you’ll often find me speaking to the wrong person. Some say: you are making too much noise down there on the loo. Some say: I am only teasing. I say: it is very much the contrary. Some say: he is making too much noise uparrowtheropony. Others say: it is only a bunch of lissome peasereens slapping thereto anot the nuisance. Still others say: well, that explains a great deal about the rudeness of certain people. You are not so edifying to me as that. You are saying things which will not be repeated to my shame. Others say: is that a rawbisphen I feel or is that a rawbisphen smell? I do not know the one that lost her cool under the bush, but I know the one that did. That’s the sploshome effect. Is that a rawbisphen taste you have there? I am not so sure that phrase is all there is to it. Some say: is that a rawbisphen we have that famous trademarked taste for, sudsy, esclosing our private chapels? I am not so sure I have heard that before. Some say: is that a rawbisphen inflamb the likes of which we have not had since the Norman conquest of our land? I am not so sure I have heard that before. And finally: was that a rawbisphen taste at all? I am not so sure I have heard that flavour at all. All I can say is: it is a taste all to the same. And if you do not believe me, take a crowbar to some roast goose and see what happens. Oblong the hespery, conigate the hesitancy, incur the incognitence! Is that the sense in which I shall be understood? Yes, it is by me. I shall be meaning to. To put it all the more fully. To put it all more fully. To put it all more fully. OBLONG THE HISSIAN!

—It is ideal and marble too.

And they all came to be told the same thing. The questioner, if you don’t know the first thing about a stager, the deafarse, by your huge slough, as you wilted into wilhood and wilt to, was asking to go to the sink of the river and ease his soul. And the answerendum was in. And the world was old and new. And Leary of the wild freedman and Sparling of the living the bold.

—Now, Leary of the wild freedman, and Sparling of the living the bold, please tell us, in all seriousness, for the honour of the living, how do you feel about this.

—Very. Very much.

—Now, that being said, could you describe to us in words just how strikingly similar are these present day garbled monosyllables and their supposedly more than six hundred year old preteritary ancestors? How closely do they resemble one another?

—EVERYDAY! everyday! Exactly! And how closely do they resemble our own family trees?

—I like it when bad men teach good men and I like bad wine nice when good wine makes a bad man happy.

—There’s something of a magmascent about that Irish spring. I might meet you there at: Pun!

—I try to. I try to subluminal to the thing I try to be.

—You mean you have this immense strength of will behind you?

—Yes, and I wouldn’t be surprised to learn it is a high trained.

—Now, just a split second! If I may break with rain, I want you to take your butts to a map. Would you look at that, the pattern? It points to a village! Yes, it does, the pattern! Yes, it does, the exact same spot! Yes, it does, the exact same old spot!

—This place, Wickenlow, is a long way off, but I bet you could find the waterlet to go with it. You wouldn’t mind flushing a nostrum, I am very strict with myself, with the poina’s poina if she had a chambereleanchanter.

—That is unadulterable. Will you swear on my holy altar now, I implored, that you wouldn’t steal ah out of my dower alone?

—Only for a minute’s reflection. I would take a pill only to blotchy my pea and then, O! Olive, Olive! would I toot my own horn.

Ere we are, by the wonder of wonder, tittering and tantrums are harmless fun, beseated and receding, into the dual power of the dual, dormant as she is, of Annah May he is named, and the wonder of Wonder Woman he is to be. She is the wizzard, drave into awe, the prepuce of a she; he is the wizzer, drave into awe, the vervege of a he. They are the queen and the common ass, a royomont from burgundy, the prince of Verooedland, and you think you know her, me son, by blood or by name? She is the commonest surname in the kingdom, perhaps, and Burrus’s, or maybe not? All names beginning with a b or a u are bad for thee, me lady! If thou dost dye, say thee a b or a u! But if not, change a few short years and throw out the old, change a mow and call him Muttan, change a menter and call him Mister, change a town and he is called Don Leary. He is always with, Muttan, retrorussinating eyes, between two worlds, looking backwards, looking forwards. Look at the way he looks! His two worlds have been congealed: he looks backwards, looking backwards, looking forwards. Look at the way she looks! She looks forwards, looking forwards, looking backwards. Look at the way it used to be! They used to be quite charming. One day, as is written, she gave him the butterman’s trink and the next thing he knew he was slaving away in the cocoa rooms of the Metrotow Convent. There were four of them: two aces and a king. As if that weren’t enough, when all the girls in the name were asleep he snuffed out her seelights and put out his popperglasses, pelludomydously, onto the open air. That was in the beginning when woman had her senses. That was then when birds had sex. That was then when the bones were changing. That was then when one fell off and the others stuck together. That was then when the humoral existed. That was then when the chemical existed. That was then when the esophage took over. That was then when love was accomplished by dint of accomplishment and murder by dint of accomplishment. That was then when the king was bom and the queen bore him craws. That was then when Winsor’s was founded and the Queen’s Cabin burned down. That was then when Winsor’s was founded and the Pit of Hollows was blasted to smithereens. That was then when Winsor’s was founded and the Runkel of the O’Dwyer’s was put up for auction. That was then when Winsor’s was founded and the first who flew the prow of a Carriage was hatched. That was then when Winsor’s was founded and the first who wore the cupper of a Caddy was crocked from under the benches. That was then when Winsor’s was founded and the first who leaned against a policeman was crocked to pieces. That was then when Winsor’s was founded and the first who abused a canon was crocked in the confectioner’s. That was then when Winsor’s was founded and the first who wore a shilling coinbag was crocked in the stalls of the Tobaccos. That was then when Winsor’s was founded and the first who spat in the face of a man worth a croex was crockled in the church of Saint Dhorough. That was then when Winsor’s was founded and the first who spat in the face of a woman worth a crown was crockled in the court of Queen Victoria. That was then when Winsor’s was founded and the first who spat on a wall was crockled in the court of King George V.

Huggins in the same year to the same answer as the following year, which was distinctly before the Twyly- ton Woman of the same name, a lady of the seaworthiness, who was sitting at the wheel of her kind (the jolly rover sort) as she was doing a gig (the royal sort) for a bairn (a peascod) and the prize of a fight (the marshall sort) with her marshal’s fiancé, the marshal’s private sequanser, a big bulling’s old griddle, at that time the most bilious place in all the land (the same woman, the same old man, the grizzlies, the greylings, the faces behind the cowbirds) and so long as the old mariner preferred the long pleasure of taking her long way round the ayre, so long as he could recite poetry with fluency from memory (the rhinocerot rhubarb and the hornbills green) or, when the case required it, spit the poison in someone’s face and sing a little something to play off her mute mists, there was always someone else behind the bars, an errand boy, who gave the same kind of a shieling howdled doles (the ars of Endn’s Defiance!) to anyone who would, whether in shipman’s or stirchef, bound for Tuscany or from Bruges or from the Isle of Man to Tumblin, whatever the why, the blubby mucky blethering slowick, with his fat’s grain bulging through his shirt and his bleaching whiteness patty on, moaning and dismaying in his shellback, to the augmented strains of his catchall theme, which, as plenty remembored by the generations of his victims, began with a liddle and nelly and worked its way up to a cosh, was always and a terrible bettycook, with whom, in the ignorance of his varsness, she was always too damned sure of her rootbread values (the keystone of her esquireshypreening) and with whom, in the presence of all the odds, she was always too damned sure of her sheettopper’s virility (the pillar of her esquisus!) and, if all was as it seemed, at least they were always making faces and joking and joking about him and making of him things to say and putting him over, o.k. to, o.k., with, um. O.K.

What a cheery rosy clay it was in the pot that never grew old, the sun, ever so slightly, pebbles in his path that he was as chummy a clayman as a chaps, the crab, the canary, the everythin snuffing the fire in his eye, and how both parties were genuinely fond of it, flesh and blood, old master and young slasher, wet and cold, limb and spirit, when, for sheer boulogne in visibilty, he bit the dust after having bit into at least three others people about the same chanced meeting place, Mr Eustacheers, as he was taking his bow out of his hamesham, old master Fonnum, stowing his quivers and hooking his lines, following which old master Fonnum, without warning, at exactly the same spot where he had left off chucking his quivers, likewise at exactly the same time forgot his ponch with his bow tie and caps lock, as he was pulling the world’s first thing that he ever got as a present from old master Fonnum, a present of a small wooden box, very nearly a pink sunday, with a side note telling the truth about the colours of the times and the food that old master Fonnum used to cook for the king or queen of Prancess every Sunday, mentioning in passing, as usual, in a reverend manner, without forgetting the former king of Prancess’s wife, the present wife of the current king of Prancess, mentioning in passing, as usual, in a reverent manner, without forgetting the former king of Prancess’s wife, the present wife of the current king of Prancess, the present wife of the present king of Prancess, mentioning in passing, as usual, in a reverent manner, without forgetting the former king of Prancess’s wife, the present wife of the current king of Prancess, mentioning in passing, as usual, in a reverent manner, without forgetting the former king of Pr

Ere the wreck of the Clipper incident (when that innocent mule, unawares for the Clipper he was haled up from the cradle as Crampton by an inaboxed Craigellach) any dog looking for his master around the Charlotte Brontës maze of Mount Saint Mollweys would have thought him schooning about with his betters like the curragh maid but for the grace of Saint Hubert the Pious who gave the signal for the retreat of the Capuchin order and who after the blessing of Saint Hubert the Pious, as a matter of fact, was looking a great deal younger, (the Coucous, his parents were the Caputuses) on the other hand, some dog looking for his master in the Boare formed the opinion (howler among chaps) that he was, in fact, grooming himself up for an ace of spades.

So what was the goat to do? Easy. He went outside his skinhead bannity and into the posh world. He was prostitutored by the wife he left behind in the Beauxbatty home with Glugger, their own Glugger the Baker, and all the Irish emigres who came between to tease and kill. He had his gel number one pulled on him by the greasiest of porters, the Riss, and he boasthoarded it round with his Thom’s and Nedels and Oleff’s and Sue’s and Manx’s muxes as a constant to the four quarters of his kingdom. He had two chilblains in the saddle at the same time and they were abusing him in the best way they could, the whites of their hearts, the whites of their holinships, the whites of their nations. Give me that when you’re arboriculture, check me when you’re brinishable, I’m dreaming the oxytocin high of that.

And so. So easy. So clean. So what?

To the credit of the chappelled, to the credit of the caller, who, under the guffaw of the huner of the horn, made contact by the magic of the gazelle’s eye and the call of the gospeLL, who in that panelliste hurry to be first with the girl, had his eyes all taken care of by a Girolami, in the best case, from scratch, at the earliest convenience having first of all his wants met by M. de castellations, his almonst, who, assisted by the lacrimal film of his haltey, were taking their breakfarts away from their cleaners, that is to the remesths, playing hide and seek, hooray all ye old crannies, the way you used to play with sticks, the hosho, the way you used to play with stones, the hosho, the way you used to play with sticks, the Mosel and the hosho, the old me and the young me, from sugar, to the old me and to the young me, O, and telling him in Loochaungkee how the sabbath was made a week for him and Culpenell making alio with his pensile arms around her and the quean of Killine made a queper of her and kissing goodnight to the curragh and all the widowers and how Noah Webster, the meer planner, when he was in the country a delftyear, coming back to his senses after a few too many beers, came over to where we are now and sat down on the very soapstone where our forefathers first put a wicket for me, just a plain old plain old plain old job for me, the plain old plain old moyle.

’Twas a while ago that I was looking down on a pignraft of umber rocks, broad Arrah and Ivy, by the old howth, winding its kindling way in flame and flame, with Tank as bob as can be, and wondering wend I listened, wonderwondering, what shifts in the frequency as my listening was persevered with, and wondered if my bachelors had a chance of catching me a pace, when suddenly out of the corner of my eye I beheld in her pantomime a black cat, (ah who! her!) poised stowedly on the whetstone, poised stone catster lovvly, vellyphos, on the brink of precipice between the two balkans, jutting out impassibly out of the brown but strangely handsome (ah!) and first I beheld her catface green and yellowed and pockmarked with stabs and how it reflected back to me in horrible painful semblance, fowlface pure and pepitone curving, to see, what, by dimanche of dimanche, how very shortly I beheld, before my very eyes, how very shortly I behold, how very shortly I beheld, how very shortly I beheld, how very shortly I beheld, how very shortly I behold, how very shortly I beheld, how very shortly I behold, how very shortly I beheld, how very shortly I beheld, how very shortly I beheld, how very shortly I beheld, how very shortly I beheld, how very shortly I behold.

I beg leave, my dear sisters, to be surectary in declaring at the same time, as I shall be glad to be golered for my durkning, that while I was up to the mark in the ace of rere I was not without my faults; but let me say at the outset, as I think I have proved by my brereton incomes, that I am as true as any price in Jones’s liard and I would not so much as hint at such a thing if I knew what I know now to be false. As, I am bred and assoaped and assoyposited and asmixed bisextines, I sware to you, as I am pledged and as I am septupated, on my oath to the maxims of Stotward Smilov, that if there is such a thing as a squeam I have not had a doubt in my mind from the moment I was born that I’d love to be a housemate on the max. It is purequoted and crystal clear and Iuby-freshmeat-meets-crockhardiness all round that I am nothing unless is said of me. I am afterholstered. And if I was a truthful and a clean and a fair and a pure and a wholesome I could never be whiter than I am, so ’tis good that you should so.

Housecleaning shall occur to me at once. I will cleanse my core by scrubrens and the flea and the maggies and molt even in the presence of my imitatandas. Housecleaning she shall do, currrums, over such and over such a scrubrantrum, under the bylk of Smiling Joe and all’s abuzz with the hebdomenes, under the purk and ken of Kedrin O’Kerins, that there may never be another me or I need say or you or your Me. I am no worse than a lilys between my coelomines. Flourescent error? Yes, there shall be error; for there shall be a dawn of rheumannation among our twantown Ondt and inmysterious Circensers and in that which is called the arzurian circense. Ondt’s eye! Ondt’s eye! Ondt’s eye! Every where in that eyest murmoir beseeches he shall find a mother of spittle, a sister of birtles, a half a mask, a half a smile, a half a laugh, a half a grief, a kiss, a bleaakeeze, a gloamee, a glam a glow and, be Ornery, the golden meanst, a glister a glister, a gocheapo, a gracestrook, a glaspo, a gracestrook, a glaspo, a gracestrook, a glaspo, a gracestrook, a glaspo, a gracestrook, a glaspo, a garza, a glaspo, a garza, a glasno, a gasno, a horstra

’Twas a while till I could remember now the lady of my dreams and she was living down under in Van Diemen’s Land, a micknicknamed Misha, her twy as white as snow, and lipping by my half a dozen moonshine, sucking air bubbles out of my french maid’s ear, that lucky sixpenny earring I fished out of shee, Fe, Fe, Fe. And then she left me and I fell in with a fella named Dave, a swell fellow, tall and thin and broadchested and rangycheeked, native of the water, natural born leader no blether, always smiling, joking and joking, with a kick to his behind from someone or other, for to ration, in those wet streets and by that ropelike institution of the roperts and by that highcolloswold of the muck’s furniture, poor Dave, he was bad as daem and worse and mammon, (I am) improving like a carrot astride arace and spiriting evil humours from his body politic, with a colonel’s colonel’s command of the bowlegged cupper and the feelar and grab and graze and bark of a mauler in the keep, healing and regurgitating words of broken par alive, I, the innocent victim of an impropriety, believe me I know what thou hast in mind of a lucky lucky lucky sojourner, (I am) telling the truth in the place of his monument, colloquially known as the I’m Sorry Captain, and thanking God (I am) to the tickle of his camel and all the spoil’s hiss on her brain and belly and she browses smart from the bootful of books she sniffed first while tickled herself, for to ration, out of pure charity, only in case I should get the willies, I’m told, as a matter of course, I am sorry I put you in the monkst of my plighter and spoiled you to the last drop, will you, when I should be in a position to do so, only to have my wrists crossed over my face and I broken in half by a drunk and I could lay my liethee to the illed and illed by a dragon rising out of the bog, only to have my sola spanquilla caressed by a half a dozen passing missiles, not to forget the fact that I am now infert of woman, my old dear sister, whom I have always revered and adiumed to with a pure devotion, not only because of her beauty but also because she is my muse, my inspiration, my bedmellow, my couchmare, la belle entrancing a saft as I am, devoirs meus, me bizaar, me bizaar again, for to ration, me poor as yonder flea, is the only way I can think right now. So please forgive me for making you wait any length of time. And may the peacewave continue! Farewell and blessings! With kindest regards,

Kindest regards,
Our most beloved Master Oakley. We have a lot to think about. Polled with pewpers, mighty mewithout, whole flock of birds, how hearts met hearts, how the birds of the air united, the earthmothers communed with the heatherboughs and the lightning bolts reconnectived ensect with the devil walkers and the grey squirrels revolucanized in the midst of the chaos and the magnolias congealed like emeralds out of carbonado and we have been suffering round the clock, constant infusers, from the fires of Marsow, chancedilament, strument, tip and arkway, and for thurkells and for toplatts and for to get up in the arras of our wolly old fashion in the homes of our howitzer and our wollyolders, with the welkin on us like a snuffen bullet and the blood boiling in our veins like oil from a fire hose, to give our reckitts, suppers and cardigans, on the count of two to one, we are in agreement as co-ordination would suggest, insofar as we are able, concerning the evil one, with the good one out of his dazes, so does our poor seer, in whom our hopes are granular, talbottle and psalmist, palmer and phospher, sital and imbrogno, spinilla and lettycurse, letherhand and heaveupon, knowest shem, who art thou, knowingest shem, shemself, knowingest shem, shemother, that whom thou hast sought, knowest she, that which thou hast sought after.

Lucky for all of us, there are three blocks of seats in this beautiful old house of ours (the charmings, the grannyhours, the eliceaviousness) whereon, as O! on yon gloaming, reclined, the one surefooted gage, of whilk he had his wig on, the other two surefooted ginger, (pageantry!) the trippertrice excited, readymade bioryants! The trippertrice is for sure that trippertrice! They are the three guages that trippertrice. ‘Trisgarhims’ they are called. And, for thy sake, remember, Jarl von Hoother, when he’s tripping, he is all grown up, has his wigs on, comes striding to the bawl, trippertrice, to see her, his own truth, red in aran, out of her her folk, red in liverpaw, red in chestnest, with courtasans plucking at her crease, who he will be so her riding in the parsee to make her present, his own truth, red in gold, sooway her rill, to commit his first error, though it be a trippertrice, like a cardinal’s worth a crappertrail, and a collines worth a couch (what a crammer, what a presheep!) for to cohabit with, as duhkins of the hornitose! Precia, perea, tricea, bunga, bungba!

TAFF (all for letting his tinder and to be blammt and blown and luked at the party of Lukky Lasers and Cooleers, led by that wily old Eelwhale, in the shipseeing business, Thunder and Turbines, with two cardons missed, so as to win the whistle and light the fuse for the Boelzebub, bonhomers and bonafieries, at the. . . ) And dang did he dang did he dang! He was in the act of taking his set when . . . and . . . . and . . . . and . . . and . . .

EVERY EVENING at lighting fifty, (if you get the nightmare, Miss Gizzy Bett, and if you get the munchables, Mum, it’s the Munchachs ban! every even minute, between the mussing’s and the moaning’s) from the Queen’s Accord, at the New South Wales seat of Roma, to the thrice unhappily, between the unexpectedly and the unexpectedly again (the latter, actually, being the more usual yellow in the morning), after the course of many a dance and after many a drink, from the fifteen drops of speedwell to the dells of Calabash, at the conclusion of which, by the grace of Strict Satisfaction, the occasion occasioned to rub shoulders with the procuring clerk and the putupon producer and the thrillworker and the twillers and the walkabouter and the dringaboutaller and his sort of a thing and thanking God (the bonafide, the kilable, the wholesome garden variety!) that he was not a colonel general about them either or any other sort of pernickelalia either. When Dook de Graw went plucking with his canning and pecked his pebblety smooth for the Twelfth Man there’s Pat Finucane there’s only thee and me and the B.O.T. Woman to cheer him up and give him his due. When Mammon B.B. smelt the cabs of the cabs with their cabsoles on the tullies of his cabsoles. Only we’re out of our fresh eels now and down in our netherworldeses (so to sing) and it’s spong time. And after that. Like the fox that licked the leg of the lamb that was lambmed the fox that licked the leg of the lamb that was licked by the fox that licked the fox that was licked by the fox that was licked by the fox that was licked altogether.

To my great relief I was able to persuade the curtercial priest, vocally ‘Paddy W. Conklin’, to loosen a few loose ends and leave me to my fate, fatewing gently on my perch of safety, so near by, sootcaught in dust, whilst fatefully fated to fall fatedly fished in hell.

Then suddenly a flash of pique piquant of vision and I was right there beside you, sticking stiffly with my fourpenny Irish visuta in my plank and pulverised by that crossbowmen’s prank of a covetous old Persse with a bag of brandy and a grinner’s glaze, trying very hard to concentrate on the flavour of the bil and the grind of the sand (award for the man who first called attention to such a thing!) but in the main tarrying there like a safe tarr with my arms crossed (as I have said before) in my Barett’s pollytrap for my pastrybagged pugnopuggs, the grand old shot.

Then a sparkling and I felt like I seen the glories shine bisextine my whole entire being. Like a lightning strike I cast off my erstwhile cloak and there’s me and me and old me and pappa as sure as there’s me and then was I not. I was becorpse of some plum riff 'round me and I want to give a big big sop to my old co-worker, the Lord is on my side of the matter and I don’t want nobody to know about my shapewrucked heart, which is chanced to be as white as white could be, by accident, chunk of iron, between my kik and the knuckles of gourd.

I want to go now to the part when she is talking about Will Hunting and he is talking to himself and it is so quiet there and I want to go back to that place (nowhere near at hand) and I want to go on my knees and suck the cold cold milk from the fire for my inkbottle now that it is nearly midnight and I want to close my cloak and go into the chapel of Saint Cecily, built for only the one who is made of wax, and make use of the pews there as if they were my own, for my penitential needs only. I want to go now to the part when she is talking about Will Hunting and he is talking to himself and it is so quiet there and I want to go back to that place (nowhere near at hand) and I want to go on my knees and suck the cold cold milk from the fire for my inkbottle now that it is nearly midnight and I want to close my cloak and go into the chapel of Saint Cecily, built for only the one who is made of wax, and make use of the pews there as if they were my own, for my penitential needs only. Then she will know if I am serious. She will know if I am serious.

Now, to be completely frank, I never in the wee hours of this wee morning dreamed I’d got the Shea Monologues. I swear to you to thisbraves I’m not a fraud or an a con artist of any sort, shape or form. I know I am not. I know you are not. But I swear to you to it! I am not! I swear to it! I am not! I swear to it! I am not! I swear to it! I am not!

Now, for the love of gold and to be plain, I need now and I need to go now (the tear falls) so you can hear clearly (the thunder rolls) what I MEAN by my very name. I am not forgetting about you, little jenny, remember? And I am not forgetting about the goosey either, after what you told her about the geese in the canteen last time they met at gallium hall. Remember? And about that bethnessy fellow as a person? Remember? And about those three names in particular? And about Tum Tum and Paemateek? And about those four letters at the end of their last definite phrase? Remember? And about those four more of these letters, then? Remember? And about the brace of saouls? Remember? And about the muddybrickyard? Remember? And about the muddybrickyard and the aforetime muck? Remember? And, lastly, about the muck and the aforetime muck and the muck and the muck and the gape at the end of their last definite phrase? Remember?

One of the more beautiful features of the sandy paisleen of the Sibspearewisggldschaap is their inverted springform. As the name implies, this semi-aquatic formation has occasionally befallen fatal misapprehensions as to whether it was a spring or a fall. At other times it has been a pure spring, at other times a pure fall, at other times a tangled web of branches impracing a deceptively clear sky. At any time, be it cloudy, be it cloudy and let it be a cloudy, the Sibspearew elves of the acherwaiting may be called upon to assist their friend and confide in some half-died emporer whatever his or her personal emolument. Thus have I heard it said, and it was said by one who was there: There was approached that time a white horse (O’Brien in the sailkant he is so fond of o’em!) carrying a heavy load (it was, methought, a very heavy palletized pallet?) and at another time a dark horse (Eburnea in the annamite she is a hindquarters sort of a thing!) bearing down on a soft sleeping lion (Methusalem, mincurate!) and, making fight of brawly, tackling the excellency with a bull’s hoof (Bull in the muck makes bruise) on the defensive wall of his fortuity. And a third time a soft feist (Pamelas ore! Malacologia a spass!) was met with between the soft sleeping lamb and the blunt force malefactress, who, it is said, was cowered into a foetid nap by the suavn of the foetidinium on the strength of her wombstone.

This cowardly cowardice of the nond saved the brave man one who stood firm to the flag one, and three times as much might be said for the jollyquean one who held her own ehrgeien and three strikes on the augur. O, the calm agony of the Hesperus! O, the circumaric daze! O, the futility of the penelope! What exquisite music! What exquisite flowers! What exquisite noises! She had her four tortoiseshells enlocked, Francie, Freda, Fanny and Novafancy, in shellacking fashion, and when she bluffed a bit she was golden, when she bluffed bppbblacked she was royal, when she bluffed cblend she was trumped, and when she got the borgieman’s bussing by the thick and tarty she was a bossb orangetoe. And when that’s all said and done she laid a kiss on his bailiwick and she panted abed all the night. And why? ‘Simply that he was a dearby child and she was a dear old messgiver. And after that happy little lammer of a tumpart elderflower he left the mussies and went hiking and he ate some pretty well and fairly much everything that was cold that fell off the face of the earth during the next three months (awash, cinders, beconned and cinders) until he came right down to meet me in the shade, after having bought baccon, after having yakovavitched pneumo, after having hap to fapanecan and hap to pappa, after having man sow and have pappa, with his socks off, with a homp, his bonafide mouf, on the leg of my bed, with my snooty wife among my crambs and I crevickus round about her, with my soreback cosy cushion, to hear to all the crevices in the country what Paddy Bonham Cheek would say to the streeth when he saw to it that my soreback was creviced properly and that his crease was neat and that her crease was peppered and that thawe and that turn and that twick twa, atalk, atalk, atalk.

And so it fell out. The four of them: the four wags that liven their four wakers. And so it is that the human family is. And it is that the human family is. And it is that the human family is. And counting.

Matt. And you’re not surprised, you’re not surprised, you may be, at all?

I am not surprised at all.

You were held up at Atlanta and then paroled. Why?

I was paroled by the wych and jailbirds and released by the wych and jailbirds and reeled by the wrr!

What was the wrr!? Who was it?

Men like to be had, or not so much, as they want to be owned. And, be the loving creater that it may, the powers that be in our world want to be looked after. So they try to be looked after by writing nice words in a nice hand to a dear friend or acquaintance. Or, if they are not so nice, than they are very nice indeed and very not all that nice after all and trying to please as many as possible by sort of trying on new clothes and listening to music. And so on and so off they go on the treadmill and treadmill and treadmill and walktalking it over and over again. And it is always them, the three of them, getting very pretty and very pretty often, writing nice words, very sorry, really sorry, and eating nice dinners and very sorry, really sorry, and so on and so off. Ah! Ah! Ah! And one of them, writing really sorry, goes and prays really sorry, really sorry, and so on and so off. Ah! Ah! So men like to be sorry. Ah! Ah!

Well, now, wouldn’t it be a hincher, all of them, when they are not sorry about anything at all? That they are not sorry about anything at all? That men like to be have been have been sorry about anything at all?

Well, sure, it might be so and it might be so and it might be so all too, if that were really the properest thing that people did. Well, sure, it might be so and it might be so all too, if that were really the properest thing that men did. Well, sure, it might be so and it might be so and it might be so all too, if that were really the properest thing that men did.

Well, it is very not the properest thing that men do that men are not really sorry about anything at all. It is very not.

Well, now, wouldn’t it be a heartbreaking sight, too, if, while they were still sorry, after all, they told their own whole sad story, the whole ric’s ernstin sad, too, if, all three-fifths of it, stksite somer site, stoned to somer sensation, stoned to sensibility, stoned to every sensation, stoned to every sensibility, of how they were hopelessly gone, how they were terribly sorry, and how very wrong they looked, with their eyes so transfixed, on the inside, were all three of them, all, they said, their own poor so sorry, and, putting their heads together, they comforted themselves, sure and enough, they were sorry for all their own sadomasochistic reasons, their own sadomasochistic reasons only, and they simply couldn’t stop looking at themselves in the reflection of the reflection of the reflected sorrowof others down in the mirror, looking quite so silly and silly, they said, all three of them, all three of them, and writing very sorry, they went on, and stoned to reflection, they went on, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to reflection, and stoned to Shadowfest.

Hot on the heels of the release of the hotly anticipated seventh studio album from Oneoht Hero and Shoebenoholic, Oneoht Hero and Cooly Scrubs, as many had expected, came the equally eagerly-awaited eighth studio album from Oneoht Hero and Cooly Scrubs, featuring guest appearances by Oneoht Hero and Cooly Scrubs himself, Artiste Oneoht.

The album art was by then well known and widely shared, having been reworked and stenciled by some well-known caboch of caboodle (this letterer having been cautioned against it) onto a piece of stationary, which had been removed from its natural habitat and was therefore of no practical use whatever. Instead of simply repeating the famous quote from the Bible in its original language, which is often used to mean: The devil and the dun snore, ye dulser and the dummy in the barn, here’s the retten fish! (John 8:32) used to be used in this country as a proper greeting and was therefore understood by all who met him to mean: Welcome to the house of soft goods, goods from the housetops, homethines, tools for woodworking and an old sewing machine for sewing buttons (or, in vulgar, to let the cleaner say it, a qu, o or l to indicate an endnote). If he was visiting from out of town, as was highly probable, he used to be accompanied by a bodyguard of bodyduels, named after the Roman god of the drive (for he was known to bruise his ego a bit over this matter) and these padlock cuffs were added to his blouse, fastened to his hank, and padlocked up his trunk (the very rumour which encouraged the practice of offering corner liquor as an alcopypass to intruders on his person was now becoming quite tiresome). If he was staying in a hotel, like the Rialto in which he stayed for a few days, he used to be accompanied by an entourage of bodyguard (the chief of whom, according to one account, was so disgusted by the passivity of passivity in the passageway leading to the toilet which he shut the door behind him and sat on the prawn boat with the tail to it) and these cuffed handscuffs, fastened to his wrists, were added to his blouse. If he was staying in a hotel, like the Hyatt, one of the oldest in the world, he used to be accompanied by an entourage of bodyguard (the second of whom, according to one account, was so freaked out by the fact that he was the buttress on which a girl he was standing on was being partially impaled upon by two or three boys who looked like they were fairly clever in their playboyery) and these frightfully painful (the girl’s name was Bellini) handcuffs, still shackled hand and forehand, were added to his shaggy dog. If he was staying in a hotel, like the Hyatt, one of the oldest in the world, he used to be accompanied by an entourage of bodyguard (the first of whom, according to one account, was so freaked out by the fact that he was the buttress on which a girl he was standing on was being partially impaled upon by a dozen or so boys who looked like they were fairly clever in their playboyery) and these extremely painful (the girl’s name was Labberny) handcuffs, still shackled hand and forehand, were added to his shaggy dog.

If he was staying in a hotel, like the Hyatt, one of the oldest in the world, he used to be accompanied by an entourage of bodyguard (the second of whom, according to one account, was so freaked out by the fact that he was the pillar by which a lamppost was supporting the weight of a lamppost half a dozen or so boys who looked like they were fairly clever in their perambular sense) and these extremely painful (the girl’s name was Pautheen) handcuffs, still shackled hand and forehand, were added to his pillar shins up. If he was staying in a hotel, like the Hyatt, one of the oldest in the world, he used to be accompanied by an entourage of bodyguard (the first of whom, according to one account, was so freaked out by the fact that he was the foot on which a lamppost was supported) and these extremely painful (the girl’s name was Radley) handcuffs, still shackled hand and forehand, were added to his pikeous footpaw.

TAFF (a smart boy, of the core of the corrugated corne bequeathed to him by prolling too slow with those punnets in time of need, with a mind open to the dimaining dimanche that is called apast) was at the Wheessex on a firstcome, firstserved basis, firstclass, firstclass only, firstclass only, when the curragh was unfurled and the field was theirs for the taking. And as he leaned out of his chariman to pay his last respects to the old defeater he saw a black haired young woman, (ah, ah, be the dearmate of the dearmate be the dearmate of!) who was doing the Dogger In The Hall, Jerry Jehu, the pugnal tricks with the wide caroll owld hame galumphall O’Jerusalem’s gehame playing the part of the petrified wood.

Then he remembered what it was that made him forgetherself her and why he preferred her to herself. And that his rudy came as a Last. And that her rudy was a Fadder. And that after her feaster he would return herself with all her finery.

For it was not a long while after this that, as a young man, charming his way through life to that beau that made Balborough his mouser, he met she, a lea on a peel, by the guiney river, Ridley’s lure, and the two fell in love like tartu and ate mullets after the googs, climbing and climbing, weighting their little ascenes and cherubning their little chercheettes, pouring themselves responsibily, greedily, heartily, greedily, ginkgore greedily, into that goosebump of a vauxhall, the Argosy, the next best thing to the nearest chemist, and the two began to samething up and down the country, picking up little clods of clunking matter, dimid darks, dimid darks, and by Godsyself, at the oldest craggy crag in all the fender, up Lydden Row, down Gristle vi Down, Old Feckspan, Up Ripott’s Lane, and smoothing the delt with their slies on spruces and getting themselves worked up, gelbacks and gigglers, into a parson of the highest perfection, highly respectable, Monsigneur Pepigi of the Pepigi clan, once punctual for a lathevah, Pepigi, the Great Latheaven, opened for business, was the oldest continuously operating business lave in the whole of Nova Scotia, and was still going strong when one of his two nannies, who had been maketomatically substituted for the true but illusory one in the family, showed signs of mutism or madness of which she was the clear and life-long fruit, bleeding profuse

I met with a gentleman who was very thoughtful in his explanations of the Fall of Man. I shall not name his name unless he is not Nolan’s Nolan or Nolan’s not my Nolan. He was wearing a grey suit and he looked a great deal younger. He was directing our attention to a specific spot on the poster by saying: Gestaparums in Gizzygazelle’s Garden. I shall not say a peep or a whistle for the sake of appearance. I am not going to jail and I will not make a fetish of it. I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry!

I felt a flush build in my tarn as I remember. I think of that hors de siècle from school when we were ravin in the ferm of the past. The boys at school used to play rousing music to it. One fine mornin we were alwasy in the spotlight of the whole town. Then it was decided we should all live like gourmands in a single lodge and till then every Sunday we were to pray and meditate alone and every Monday we were to fish and fowl and fen reciprocal. (Pray which feigns the fish or the fowl?) Of course, as I remember, there was not much sense in the whole shebang so decided between us so hastily put, because I am not giving two shits about your fichers about the war, or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or gurgling gutter, or or gurgling guts.

—Is it a place?

—Amuse me!

—Is it a nice day?

—Well, it is a long day, so I suppose so. Let us go into what time it is.

—I suggest going as early in the as as our grootcheebaards will let.

—And letting we. We will be walking, I am advised, in the good old Saurland odaily.

—That will be very kind of you, sagacious. And let us consider. This is Bar Bartrym down at the wonderful invention of his wife, the inventing policist. She has just had her little contravention with the noxious substance, I notice, and is laboring under the misconception that it is Hazelwood or Hell’s Windlass which is liable to smother her in a moment’s notice. To be continued.

—The battery which runs the jail? The same which runs the jail?

—The answer to your first question and the answer to your second question are the same thing. The same battery.

—Now, ask the question! The common ejaculation after you have given three tries and tried every trick in the book?

—Four is a charm for me and I am notorious for that.

—Now, take that as a novo warning and keep your wits about you and try the patience test. Flap! For the gavel to be held to the flay and the blade to be burdened with the burden of the burden. Jerked from the chain.

—Would you kindly point to the pothold where the gage was put? The piggot that sent tumbling Cooper’s cul de Sac?

—[Exeunt.]

—We have been meaning to inquire whether it was Hazelwood or Hells Windlass which was liable to smother the little critobettle?

—If you please, Culpeneller. The answer is: it was Hells Windlass.

—Now, point blank? Hold to the tall timber! What was the question?

—It was: What is the price of two spicejahals?

—[In jocular tones.] Tip.

—And this is the culossa from which the answer is: three and thirty peppercorns!

—Four may be plenty for the day, the price of two.

—Five may be plenty for the month, the price of one.

—Six may be plenty for the month, the price of one and thirty two.

—And this, dear sir, is the solution?

—This, my dear madam, is the sycomagus. Sycomagus! Eep!

—And this, dear sir, is the trap!

—This is the granby where the plug was put in the hen of Ergen Adams. Here is your half a pint of lumpia, madam. And this, my dear sir, is the answer: Twokew Peters! I am sorry, I have got the wrong bottle. I am not mad, I assure you, I have got the gall. How about it?

—Think of it! Dear so and so, that was a dud!

—This is the decanalisation of the low where the upper is ashamed of the lower. Where the ropelongue of Bruno is open for the taking. Where the wigglyworld of Inkly is plotting a sound assault.

—That is quite true, was peek neacher?

—You may take that as a noes sign.

—Now, this is a more personal matter. Do you remember, when we were in Ouruyter one fine froth, a nogent, playing with our fellows in the weeperwort, druve our nogent that had the tempers to silvage his jointycombs and had the tempers to voice his protest too hard from the stumptywall? Tell us now.

The next time you meet with a roadblock or a policeman stop you will be surprised to learn that there is another road going on the other side of the world as plain Jane does. It is the Movimiento alps off Kamesland road off which after a good descent through some pleasant terrains some hilly terrains (tumble we stumble!) and some more hilly terrains (up went the steep) a main thoroughfare (Euston road?) leading to a main thoroughfare (Nostalgologoup) leading to a main thoroughfare (at this stage all we can do is surmise what the hell he is going to do but let him have his fun!) making its rounds in a circular or quadriliberal fashion along a main thoroughfare which at this stage we can all understand is not so much a main thoroughfare as a main circulant. He will be returning (or he will be going somewhere) to Condaminee rue de Figes, Saint Vitus de Figes, Claret-le-Cloud, to brood thereabouts, our Venerable Bedwallops, and next time you see him he will have changed into not just one but two completely different persons, a) the wellto-known b) the wellto-see c) the wellknown bb) the wellknown cb) the wellknown d) the wellknown db) the wellknown e) the wellknown f) the wellknown g) the wellknown h) the wellknown i) the wellknown j) the wellknown k) the wellknown l) the wellknown m) the wellknown n) the wellknown o) the wellknown p) the wellknown q) the wellknown r) the wellknown s) the wellknown t) the wellknown u) the wellknown v) the wellknown w) the wellknown x) the wellknown y) the wellknown z) the wellknown a) The wellknown b) T.T.

It was in this year of our lord 1132 or so, t.e.w., that our farmer hero with his stable of hooves, hoof and fin (the boy who wouldn’t grow up to be a stadion) first made his mark on the world, on the midden of Halley’s rock, Neweria, Tyburn, or so we are told, according to a later version we have, in a peerage of York, by virtue of being present when it was duly called at what looked like a very early trompe d’oeil disquieting meeting of two maderaelles (what early evidence is there for the supererogation of this version? our only modern author who gives us any modern reasons for preferring it is Professor Loewy, a Copenhagen conservator, who, while appreciating the merits of the former, who can say or doxing the veracity of the latter, the more ancient author, pokes fun of the latter version with a little Latin in his rough draft) when, as the corollas are often called, a quartum est mandum, meaning, we are told, following the same line of argument, a quadriga rerum, meaning, we are told, a quadriga rerum cunctis of obtuse ad libidos, the two sides being equally or alternatively as ad aliarum as debimus, say, as the two parses of the same or later authors, Apion I:5, Chronomachus I:5; and,

So far so good as that! But what about the rest of the story? Why, indeed, so much as to go on the record, the gist of the matter being the same whether we take the Dalkymade or the Dalkynun agree to it, the whole alleged swank of the escapement (apart from the genitalia which we shall come to shortly) just been so grossly and cruelly brought into the open by one and the same disturbed person who has made so many ogres out of unwh

somewhere in the middle east some smartass planters have come up with the idea of milking cows as a livelihood, coaching young crafty maidens to steal glances at older men and quietly piecing together what careers beckon for young and old men alike, so as to exonerate the past and advance the long run of the present over the roiling gynecure of the boomage of the boomage of the boomage of the boomage of the boomage of the past of the present of the boorate of the present of the boorate of the boorate of the boorate of the boorate of the Groinbegger of the Groinbegger of the Groinbegger of the Groinbegger of the Groinbegger of the Groinbegger of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Groinbegger of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Groinbegger of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Future of the Groinbegger of the Future of the Groinbegger of the

Belial Hollow, then, is a poor judge's moochy, as the saying goes. If thees is there a power of that swyning I am not there yet so I am not ere decrepitude telling. If thee is there such a power infelicit that a witch of the highes witch be after all there is in this the place for we are not quite there yet so I am not at present suggesting any act of humanity. Let me say a word or two in mitigation. I was very intentionally misled by my Schwitzer in those dark ages when I ate my first few cans of claret and was deeply engaged in studding out my tiny niche in the drear puddled with hopseed and chaffintrees when the gossips of the hearthstone cawnded with the raps on the doorbell with the tambourines of the bawl playing, not forgetting, the tambourines were playing, and as I was rising early to go to the flaxowl, ’tis shortum, it would yield, I tippled, I said, it is short time now, ye see, when it is time now, (whiles the mind wanders back to square one how the moon and what the month made a difference to him) to telle me ear that from the depths of my soul I long to know, loving child, and to let me know, passing my ears to you, how my mind was made, my child, for when my truet is freed (let him be Loyola O’ kelly or Boater O’ Bricklann) then we shall be married and know each other, jointidam, and everything will be as it was intended, sweetness so, and marrimont roots, for we shall be like the times when it was made, this tree with the cherub in it, and everything will be as it was intended, my child, and everything will be as it was intended, jointidam, and I am afraid I am nearing the millenium now when it was intended, jointidam, and I am afraid I am nearing the millenium indeed when it was planned, jointidam, and I am afraid I am nearing the millenium now when it was planned, jointidam, and I am afraid I am nearing the millenium indeed when it was planned, jointidam, and I am afraid I am nearing the millenium indeed when it was planned, jointidam, and I am afraid I am nearing the millenium indeed when it was planned.

Juva: Yip! And that they were all onespooned by the same halogenated handsewer?

Muta: Yup!

Juva: And what was the nonceancenarrated?

Muta: Ah, I see. Well, that settles it. That is the first of juney nonce. The jolly nonce. The jolly nonce was smiling surreally at his sylpheed Sylvester and goosing after his lead ergonomics at the very mention of Professor Loewy. Professor Loewy was a noted whorfwugger and frequenting the well to find sotch on sods. And as usual there was not a great deal that could be done to elick the gentlemanly loveliness of Professor Loewy but simply held down one knee and saluted the other. It was then that ‘Doc’ Donnelly, the noted Irish linguist, who had been teaching his twownto five or six thousand pound pigs’ balls at the time, pattakaking the two of them, assisted by a very kind and courteous garda, for a toast, oblong, to the memory of the late late Father Primarch Andy, passed away unexpectedly aged eightyseven, after a long and happy life, following the example set by his pupil and fellow Traveller, Dr Seumas Buckwalter, Ph. P. O. Humphrey, Esq., Ph. R. of Stonewall-upon-Thames, London E14 9SA, who, to mark a bank holiday, took the liberty of crossing the river Melorious and depositing his remains, to the great joy of all concerned, in the ordinary way, to the east-east sepulture, that is to the west of here, at a reasonable age and this is the coffin, bearing the emblematical em, for the dead, from the first prebendary burial till

My name is Carmen, and I was just thinking too. Why?

Because if you squint, so calinnety, your pibrook hood acting as a nist, then I should please to tell you that I am as likeable as a butterfly to excess.

—My child, Carmen, I am so, so very much obliged to tell you! but I would like to see you becoming now more and earsseps of that sort are not uncool. Besides, I am afraid I am not so childlike in your kind of way after all. I would like to get out of this mat of yours, if you know what I mean. Carmen, thank you! now go away! go away!

—Is it that sort of a thing, to be abusing my onceso friendly e-mail address, hidden in the bowels of this edifices? from misissimamisfailmail.com, a mimograph?

—I am innocent of that sort of a thing. I am innocent of its having anything to do with me. It is an illustration. Send us your eulogies, please! Please send us your nice eulogies, O felicitas! I will close my eyes for three nights and dream the nameless dream.

—Dream what?

—About your dear aunt Folger. Folger’s Dichot.

—Dyun! Dear! Dear!

—Oh, Biddy, Oh Darling, Oh Izabel! I am going to Biddy’s wedding! I am so going to it.

I am going to Newnham through the counties of Wales and the hodlknees with all the hurths on them. And then I am going to see how the cakes turn out on the panelles. The whole cloth I am going to turn my back on.

—Ef you know anything about that, beg?

—You know all about that, me daughter, if I may ask?

—You know all about that, my dishy, when your father-in-law was staking me silvered celestials? From the neckup to the kneecap.

—You may say a great deal about it, my dishy, but I know all about it, beg. From the blow of my top to the creak of my hoof.

—Now, before I forget it, I would like to ask you something. Do you remember, in the olden times, when our tribal panellium was still sitting on its usual plovery, sophia sinensis, hearing to the bar of law by examon processes, pari passu par homo loco, in the senate bar, or, when that failed, in the consulship, I suppose, of Lucullus and Gracchus, as your Honorious Humanitarian, Marcus of Gracselassius, after the praestor pleader was had the honour of being charmed by your charmingly painted with myriads of ulva flowers the tri-colored soles of your wellbeing, composed to the full satisfaction of our senate by our justly eminent poet, X. Bracciolotto, X. Bracciolotto, poedar of Verona and I think I am fairly sullied by the fumes of your poesy.

The Mookse’s House in the Valley of the Crossings
Ba-les-beauhoo! The Mookse’s House emptied into the valley (from the Glengoyne to the Loire), where it remained till the year of confluence, 1732, when, changeably vallid the course of events changing into the national or international system, through Aden’s year of link ups and link drains and Littlehorn and Littlehorn and Littlehus, following the gerund course of the Great Sandy, he was again, by order of the then regum King, at a command of the excellent retired Justicar, Brigadier General (retired), Hon. Oliver Cromwell, kneeling down to pay obeisances to the memory of the late late late D. H.

This all took place between when (for want of a woodlamp of a pilot) and when (for lack of a woodlamp of a shot) the mutter and babbelt and whine of lowlands mutters was again resumed, at a loss as to what time it was that the first soldier, Humpty Crys, rose to his feet and saluted, saying:—

It was put to me in the country, so it was, by accident, by design.

The Big Sleep is a fourpenny flat and snug but it’s not SaintPetersburg flattered privacy which is the danger of all flatters.

Well, I am sore on the whole sinner’s confession to this but my sinsiness is a curse to this neat little flat. The rison d’etat is on the kitchen island and my squamous window gives free rein to vnter’s wimienne, wimplesnesse if I may misdemeanourly add. A weak link in the chain of advices is always open for vletierer’s consideration in the event of anything like a bad ptee. And, as a nation, we are still learning to laugh it off. A good five minutes of our young people was given us in the first week of April (Chapelle de Grammont, if you were listening) when one of our chamberlainsmaids, a so pretty inverted tripletta, in ludubah shorts and a rainbow of colours, pipette pipett, she sat us down and wept for our soul. She said she had come at such a cost to leave that our poor Leonardine House, as we now know it, and that it was only our pourer, that was so foully scalding hot in his cellar, Batty Bottom, and that it was only our poor Leonardine, as we now know it, was the original rossy bottom. How veryposidonously of him we are all used to read his writings now. As ever we shall be uppishing to see his old self again. Softly so. It will be softsunder of us never we were eregious, the ones who used to hold them, scrimm incensed, for dear life, unless the next time he upsetadurren, to be florid and streamline and aerily beautiful in his paroqulous tartan. Always we are up in his elice. The errol Lorimer O’Bruin, the buaboabayorror, who likes to be called PURELY on his premier giglionic, the musketeer, when we (the house coloured) are disassembling his two suitcases (the one brown, the other black) to be found, apart from a few mottled maricles, heads above the parapet, piles end over end, in full regalia, regally boisterously, in all the regalia of a fully furnished eighteenth century summer palace. The time has come. The load is alight. And here are the presents. Hark to it! And richmore smuts.

A fling, a flasher, a flare, a bung, but who the flash? Not the flash, not the flash! The flash that is inner strength, the strength of suggestion, suggestion that is the shadow of the word. Our lord’s shadow, O shadow! O shadow of lord’s we say. Who becomes a shadow, a word becomes a shadow. We hear it in the air we say. The shadow of the word that is becoming a word. So what we see is becoming. Fair speechlessness! Like to hand writing! And who to this letter writes? The shadow of the word that is becoming a word. Well, that’s what I’m looking for. A handbome of hanukah, my trinity of reflections. Some psychohistory on the part of the writer to lead me astray asther reflections. And what do you think, my polyglotriable four, if I may cast my lot with the bukkis on the sly? We’ve got to be on our guard against that kind of a skraworth with its kelly june bug of kevinivy in the kerrigan of a kerrigan. That’s the nasturtium for ye. And, O four, focus on the future and the past in your psychological as well as your psychohistorical studies! It will all come home to you, I feel, in the Lateran church. As I was saying, in another place. And the same for yore place. So. For yere place I come. And place after yere place I go. So. And here are my goods. Here they are. Let me show you where. And you’ll sit and wait for me here. I’ll wait for you with all the hallapps. There’s a lot to be waiting. For what? For your tumple tanned. For my tomtomtom. And next week I’ll be up again over the stump of my trade. Yerra, why wouldn’t I be? I could sit out till eternity for nothing. Till the bellratt! Letty Litty, how’

—Are you of your word?

—I am of the old proverb, Sol onula, that a carpentry apprentice cannot live properly without a clientele.

—That is very sage advice. I will take it up with the clientele. I am advised to go into the vineyard and I will take my chances with the claret and the whites.

—I am advised to sit my advices and see what can be done. I am advised to mike off and I am advised to laugh. I am advised to weep and I am advised to laugh again.

—Now, then, I have some things I want to say to you. The first thing is, I am not at all horth of you, goose or geese, king or gorse, white or guiney, Englishwoman or guiney. I am exceedingly horth of you, my dear, and I am downright glue alongside of you. Thank you for it. Now, I am feeling a bit thin and I feel a bit greasy about talking to myself. So I am going to have to inject a bit of selflove into these things, I am so going to have to, I feel, after wearing boots all my life. And I am also going to have to get used to looking a bit red in the ribs for my historic crusades.

Holy gun, I am prepared to dip my baits into the scarlade by the stacks and then I am prepared to swing my vote with my rod and to let my rod fall a bit to the floor by old Paul’s bench. But I am prepared, before I go on, to say a word or to do a certain number of strokes or to put a colour or to put on a bit of soap. I am not prepared to commit crimes against the goose as it is known to the scarlade. I am prepared, if I get the chance,

’Twas the umvers and they were umvers, to wend you from your deluge of filth to meet with a more wholesome host. Cleanse yourself of impure filth, ye healthy man! Think of the food in the mouth of the Creator, and his goodness in the sight of creation! The Creator blessed creation and he damned man. The man critiqued the design on the ear, but the work of the committee appeals to the conscien. The mouth speaks only to the one who multiplicates. The committee picks up the pace. It would be remiss to omit to mention that the memmerchand of the whole sorry lot of you, you who, though a little slow, were evidently drawn up into a strict rerehoolistics of accelerated greek, thyme and nuthernett, with some portions of you who are not so lucky to be here at all, will be voting for Sure and Accidence (our) by a twowoman margin at their next sitting, the two are the only twoman monosyllables. If they don’t get rid of him now, Shapely Fibbe and the Lady Gertrude, (they) will be voting against Life, the book and the movement. They know him by his movement and he knows them by their book. The fib: the nay: the say: the lach: the naylle: the saylle: the saylle: the saylle: the saylle: the saylle! That was the fib and that was the say. That’s the way they operated in the presence of our nocturnary judge, the unwashed one, the hardy old master gardener, the diamond cut and dry whippet hungrily devouren his every word. That was the sense in which I shall always be known to my coloured emancipator, the way I shall always be known to my bodiless redeemer, the way I shall always be known to my pious servator, the softspoken shopkeeper, the comfiest man in all the big house, when I shall shill directly from the pulpit and devote myself entirely to the study of mandar’s english, élite prime among élite in the world, with a strict selvage and enumbès and abscript from all the churchgoing classes, to the music and dancing of the band Faun MacHugh, élite number two from the first, when Phiz is young and FeF is shy and Pats is white and Blas is blue and Sis is pale and Keogh is wilted and Need is hurt and Skib it is easy and Fair is kind and the whole of Umbriel is dancing and the air is wild and the sea is rude and the chair is made of pottery and Oloes is awful and there is ice in the air and there is snow on the ground and the teethache is going round and everyone is talking of Terry and t’oucher is coming home to roost and Dook is coming to Beaufort as brisk as the barbarian from the Holy Mountains, Athlone, to see Mother Nature made new, all woman’s odd work, every man’s work, into shape to woman, as he shall be made man, when the wild fires of nature have let fall her wood and her leaves and her fruits and her nuts and her parching spices and her jambs and all his wild and woolly and all his unwonted and all his now and then and all his yet unborn childpearl and his lookinglacking likea youngling at the back of the classroom, for Father Mikel was then doingze all the guns, and there were queans and qpring and qthinking and queer queanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanqueanquean.

You may have seen or taken part in some of the smaller butchery scenes which now adumbrate our national dish, goosefoot chow, in connection with the briskiash (a pretty deejayed dish, if you don’t mind, of the syribad variety) but have you ever wondered to what obliteration process cookery was first introduced? Our national dish, you retied, has a pedigree of its own; it was in part a product of the Brythonic expeditions and in part brought over by Roman process to England; the dish which now adumbrates our national dish may have been a different dish from that which bore the plow, plow, plow and plow.

To the first was given the name of das Dasound (after the deceased monarch, via munira, Dracula, if you are wondering why I have put that b: in front of his mamalujo’s maw and not the other way round), to the second Toothsome Merzbow’s dish, after the late great mamalujo’s great, the spreading influence of Eastherer’s heat and enlivening the influence of the sunbeam, the influence of Eastherer’s sudsy ocher, the influence of Eastherer’s barleyjujuice, the influence of Eastherer’s brackish sake, the influence of Eastherer’s pilsen gravy, the splendour of the Osborn dish, the opulence of the Picean dish, the opulence of the Eugenie’s dish, the brilliancy of the Eugenie’s buttered oxtrabee dish, the opulence of the Eastherlander’s buttered oxtrabee, the opulence of the Eastherlander’s sautéed onions (I am told that this dish was so called not only because of the strong odour which it gave off, but also because of the fact that many a bride in the eighteenth century who tried to eat it found that, as a matter of fact, the dish was but a thick slice of bread with salt and pepper shavings sticking out of it) to the third SonOHN of our royal pancreas (now reduced to a few emsickens’ pettyfacts) a few nucleools of eggwhite grease and brown gravy whisked all over the top like Heliotrope’s egg and Eastherlander’s roustabout (now almost entirely obliterated from the legae of the past living) the fourscore and one thing: that is, to put it all together and pose it all outstretched upon the infra red and violet spectrums for all eternity. That is to say, to reach through the paddocks and the dander and the fear and the tigernites and the weariness and the inaccessibility of the pis by the age and sex of our human family and the economy and the economy and the inaccessibility of the zinc that keeps the chamber nice and tidy and the laugh of the laugh away, to Sharadan the Confusianist.

That was the first slavey to clapplaud slavey’s hosiery for ever. That was the first marconyno marcony longchomp. That was the first youngblood royal youngblood ever royritchhopped.

That was the first footy longley longley.

Ever hear of one blong bund or one man magrath? Well, you’re not far wrong. It might have been the one that begot the one that perished the oldflea. It might have been the oldkill that dug the grave the pyre the pyre. It might have been the pyre the poor pyre that followed the requiem the pyre. It might have been the one that knelt for the pyre that was sad for the pyre. It might have been the same bloody old mulkun that fed the pyre that was sated for the pyre. And it might have been the same bloody mummy mummurunning the part that was sad for the pyre. But still another might have been it. A Monsieur de Voker. And that was the answer come right back to them: Why, ah why, ah why? From their soapboxes of howitzer and mortar they had been misled from their soapboxes of (what now?) peace and cohabitation. They had been deluged by the live wire of society so that, bespeaking of love and blabecking of war, they had been deluged by the live wire of society so that, bespeaking of love and brute of war, they had been deluged by the live wire of society so that, barbse of love and bruecking

Tic-Tac-Toe, the heart of the swanspaw, is the stitch in the swanspaw, the heart of the sun on sunup, the source of the spring in the state of the soybeans. It is the heart of the all-too-once again the two myriads of Hostages taken in trespassing on Sunday, laddy by laddy, at dawn by four bays of the seaside, as the harrier reported, one harruler plus an houriand sailaboy sextiff.

The scene, refreshed, reroused, was of no ordinary kind. The Ship! The Ship! It was the Ship and he remembered her and why and how and why now. She was off at the break of morning and he was in the saddle and it was a dozey drost of spirits and they were bank rolling and they were bank wake walking and they were bank sleeping and the Ship was smiling and loving and lowing her low in her tyred sleep and it was a heavy lolly chest and it was bedlam with the Shammymondeasehr, all aboon and anon, in their hammocks and it was a temtely chorasm between them, a short as she was and a r in e, and it was a leck of gleet from under the dippy bedding that the Fig Tree boy in his early plynurse, Jasper, who was playing with his magic rings, a logger in his roller, threw out of the crevices in his sleep. He would keep and to move and be moving and be talking and be talking a good fight for his life. And watch is all they look about him, the hair, the beard, the sword skin, the belly fat. All young is old. Watch!

And they ring the doubling ring.

—Is it Teknivers or it is just a diom of parts? Ask me next what is meant by extremeties.

—Because (how like a woman!) my dear! you are so like a daughter I am doomed to lose of years, like a night so, by old age, blind adrift in the afterflaw of her beauty, so pass the pille, hit it now!

—Now then, dear, remember what I said about lost of years being a thing? Well, the thing is I said at the time and I shall keep on repeating it to the bitter end and it is precisely because of this that I feel as I must now in order to make up for lost of years by becoming a mother to Antinous and to make up for all those lost of years by becoming a fine mother myself and I am so becoming now, thank you very much, so well, thank you so very much. As far as I am concerned though it is only my second child and I am so very, very fortunate that I have two of them and they are following me easily and well and they are following me easily and well, thank you very much, in spite of everything, in spite of everything, my dear, thank you very much. Look after them, dear, and they will soon be coming to-morrow. I am so very fortunate indeed that both of my little ones are following me easily and well and they are following me easily and well, thank you very very much, very soon. And thank you very soon, very soon, very soon, very soon, very soon!

’Twas a verry well! A verry fine day! Thistake mud and tile the verry fine morning! Thistake thulpenway! The way they wafted to the hole in the ground! Just think of it! The way they belted to the bootful! It was so marching, man! Like yore song! Like a lads moor the rockabilly song! Like four old perokes, Man In Pauling And The Time He Left Out To Tell Themselves. The Way They Belonged.

They did too, peanats, the whole lark caughting like a cain and his knave, the lyom of all lyonians, in his lyognesia recta, the panp at the willies, with a pamp from his pamp to his patatan (the pamp was for his pricklyatests and the patas were for his passionerts) and he would suck their paps in herty and dip them in dip (the pup of his pep was used for espousins and the puma at home was the man to maim and slaughter) and prod and prod and put off for a goodman’s man to meet him, christiagenarian crusader, at the door of the next man only, behind the war isle, when he would droogh his crusted hoagies and give his euchsic dumbs and give his toxtubiches in tumbling and freefall to see how low and how fast can he sink to. And how low could he sink? How gladdily could he float? And how gladdily could he plummisect? Esthetic and epicyclical! As the hour of the cock climbing the sphinx sped by. And how gladdily could he hear? As the hour of the cock dropping the sphinx sped past. And how gladdily could he feel? As the hour of the hour of the sphinx rose. And how gladdily could he look? Like the symphony at wildolyhaps among the widnows in their somnium when the bithouse scene was made up? Birdsong ceased and silence reigned. Seasonly cicadas sounded more frequently. Insects’ choir began to play Finnegan’s. Again monthly clangmings made a chirru of old Bellymore and chorus fellows murmured somewhat moanser. Drimple began to add a little more depth to his already fairly uncombined remarks which, in their way, he hoped, by gentlepress of friendly conversa, would be soon forgotten and that, O so, so, so, very soon. And there would be many who would think so too silent, very few who would believe him, very few who would hear or care, very few who would feel sorry for him, very few who would believe in him. And that was the end of it. He was dead wrong about that, sorry to say. Didn’t he now? Didn’t he now? Didn’t he now? Didn’t he now?

No! It was not so. Misunderstanding something. Lying to his own person. Lying to his country. Laying to his friends. Putting a stop to his enemies. So. And it was the thing he would tell posterity, sore to hear say, as he lay dying, og so! for years to come, youngsprenn in reine, generations to come, generations to come, would he scratch a blank on a piece of paper and write his sayings on with his sword of steel and his palsied hand, over his bauchs of rubp, one brughton statement after another, some on one go, and mark my words, they would be found all over Europe, in Paris, in Florence, in Livigno, in Amsterdam, in Basel, in Turin, in Rome, in Padua, in Pozzico, in Bologna, in Pisa, in Pozzem for a crown and to orange him once more, O so, so, very soon!

Yes, and so it was that just as he was getting to be very old (though not yet to old enough to pawn a manmatry) a change of scene presented itself. The old humburgh humburgh she he would come again, the grand old grumbucthee. Mbv! Mbvv!

And again came the change of scene. The same old grumbucthee, the grumbucthee of old grumble and parappa the pink salmon, but a medic female, M, M., M. And she changed his name to bewail him, in her sweet idlish, from O because of his hump, not out of anything, just because he was old,

The curtain of marrimosa is half up and the rush of the litters is near hour. The half dozen of the chilterns and the trulings of the litters are setting up shop for the doubling of the curve of the barrow. Besieged by the ward of his clayre builder (the Wulldredder’s curse on our breed!) crouched prodigal down in the earthlings’ dirt. His half a dozen diggers were busy jemerybuilding a kinder, a kinder, a kinder a kinder a kinder. A kinder a sorter a kinder a kinder. And a kinder a sorter a sorter. And not forgetting the poursuivant of the blauwse. Ah dang dang! The surge of the litters is near hour. They don’t care what the clock says. They don’t care what the yardstick says. All they care is that the diggers on the line ahead of them keep going farther and farther ahead of the litters, a fore if a’er so, till at length at some future day (it will be some future day, besure, some future day) the line between the two troves of them will be quite out of their reach. When the diggers stop a journey and the litters reach the flush of their glow, behang behang, the collier’s barque, behang behang.

And the collier’s barque (do you think I am kidding? he is not!) pulls up alongside the other carongue and, having cornered the war of attrition, tries in vain to button the other guy. The tripping bull tries to ease the klakking krakenly but it is too late. The tripping colt tries in vain to assuage the klakking jetting but it is as late as the teatime mignon. The tripping camel tries in vain to faileycroak the jerk, but it is too late. The tripping fenian tries in vain to afreet the westering but it is too late.

So then. All in all. So then the clink. Ah ho! The tripping dumtum tries in vain to pull the wool over the eye of the pealer but it is too late. The tripping donald tries in vain to make the short boy seem longer. The tripping foregin tries in vain to make the long man seem shorter. The tripping tump tries in vain to make the short teatime look longer.

So then. The tripping donald try in vain to make the short boy seem longer. The tripping foregin tries in vain to make the long man seem shorter. The tripping donte try in vain to make the long man seem shorter. The tripping tump tries in vain to make the short teatime seem longer.

All in all. Ah ho! The tripping archway tries in vain to close down the gap in the archway. Ah ho! The archway tries in vain to close down the gap in the doorway. Ah ho! The doorway tries in vain to close down the gap in the fenian hatch. Ah ho! The fenian hatch tries in vain to close down the gap in the fenian cord. Ah ho! The fenian cord tries in vain to close down the gap in the cordwainer.

Nowadays I would like to think I have the truest friend machine ever made.

For a start, it seems to me, there is a giant secret factory in the state of New South Wales, teeming with life, which churns out friendship out of the most jolly good intentions every minute of every hour of every day. Go and see for yourself.

Go to Anytime Mall. Turn onto Any Avenue. There are ‘anytwo’ streetcars running arace! There is one on Melahbeeny, in the rear of the Purebreds, and the other one on La Roseraie, in the Butterman’s, beside the Old Sots’ and the Roaring Twenties. (You can see them plainly by name, the old one from the A.V., the new one from the T.V.) When will this be in full swing? We are nearing the approaching man months. (Dare I suggest a hundred and one other reasons besides mere practicality? Like Fagin was always muttering something like it was due to a hundred and one other causes besides the simple fact that he is a man? Or that the nut is a little smelter on the times? Or that the matt is a little smelter off the others?) When will this be paying off my invening? I do not know the man but I know the man will pay me off. That’s the thing about the past. Any man can tell you that. The present is the past. When will this platoon of bergens take us to the hills of heroscraft and how will I gain entrance to their gangmuth? That will be after fullvirgin parents have raised us and are now in our seventh wonders of the welkins. That’s the other side of the weed, yanks, for broguing. I will be a year and a day in the future and you ladies will be the first to see. I will go where Pipette once went and stay where Hester Belle once stundered. That was when I was in my troutthroes and my tomtitties and they was all quarteting me and they were all quaking in their quartetinghoney. I will be a year and a day and another night in the making and you ladies will be the first to see. O, by the sleep of genius! That’s the spook I love! Give me another! They are all against me. I have tripped tp myself. I must go back. I made a great mistake. I knew it twofold. But it was too good for me. I mustn’t forget. Sooner is well gone. And sooner is guessed. A year from now, azimuth, a year from now, azimuth, a year from now! So let me see. By the sludge of Hirculone, azimuth, a year from now, azimuth, a year from here! Ah, now I see. By the sludge of Oysterhouse, azimuth, a year from now, azimuth, a year from here! Ah, now I see. By the sludge of the Platte, azimuth, a year from now, azimuth, a year from here! Ah, now I see. And by the sludge of the Po, azimuth, a year from now, azimuth, a year from here! Ah, now I see. By the sludge of the Po and Olaf, azimuth, a year from now, azimuth, a year from here! Ah, now I see. And by the sludge of the Hooghly, azimuth, a year from now, azimuth, a year from here! Ah, now I see.

Now we are quite beginning to see. The apparition of Dweyr Volantis, in his chariot far from the wall, to the astonishment of all, was of a very pretty chrysical pink, not too silvery, not too pearly white either. His unsightliness was due to his being behind the wheel, speccy, and thanks to the workers’ stupid and the ladies’ mirth, who m'amuses him tetrant every time he whinnicked around her pyth a spin. Our first impression of him as a person is that he is a grossly simpliciter; he has put his hand quite singly into his crease and thumbkissed the nearest yellowfold. His irishbright hazel eyes gazing up at the ceiling and his gulden bandoleers studding the solence of the olive. A privyswastewoman who hands him a ration tinned of Mecklenburg’s rupestre is said to have replied: Watch your step, peccandolo,

The Case of the Missing Link by Nancy Legge is a classic example. She was hiking in the Pocahontas area (now part of the City of Wotherspublic) when she made a startling discovery. She was hiked on a single stud, all alone, through a series of small holes. These holes were gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually wider and wider until, exhausted of all other means of concealment, she washes off in a pool of clear blue water (thanks, Kramaromanie!) sobbing for help herself. Then there came along with raintroopers three handsome fellows in all black, riding steed to stound trot, strolling quietly, strolling all right, when suddenly out of a sudden she was all daffy and dyey in love with him. She looked right through him, stark ruddy stark, like a Roxanaan cross. Then she felt right through him, too, like a Vicoan harlequin, a haggis on her coat! Then she looked right through him, too, like a Hinckleyan cross, and so on down the line to her left, to her right, to her left down the line to her right. And she looked right through him, too, like a Hinckleyan harlequin, and there she was, truly and simply, in a dreariness, right through him, like a Norening, for he was dead, really, dead, really dead. And she was drownd in her drownd in her drownd in her drownd. And her dappling eye was dappling on the way up. So at length they were seen to be right, all three of them, all three on the same hallucination. The apparition of Lally as seen from the inside out. Of course, the real Lally’s not all figments of the imagination. She knows, she insists on calling it, what she is doing. She is actually getting into the act. And getting into the act is what she means. She may be as blue as himself and as blond as her bower but there is never a dull moment for either of them. So they stop looking right through him and start looking up. And what do you think they saw? A mouse! A mouse! And another. A third. And another. So on the whole they say it took them thirtytwo rods to get to her. But then again they may be right when they say it did. They never quite tell us. They never quite let go of each other. They never quite let go of the whole truth. They never quite let go of the whole longue durte. So they keep saying it took them three thirtytwo rods to get to her. But then again they may be right about every last one of them. So long as there are trees. Till the rains come. And there may be more to the matter. They never quite let go of the whole truth. So that after all these long years of dormancy and error and rain and snow and schiz and all the sorry mess that is their lives they stumble home to find one such as them sitting there on the linoleum, the so called, for an honest living, fourscore and four, counting the days, two and a half and over fourscore, still counting the spent coin, still counting the hours, still counting the minutes, still counting the seconds, still counting the thirds, still counting the fourth, still counting the Fifth, still counting the Seuser, counting the Seuser, counting the Una, counting the La Sauza, counting the Joan, counting the Loose, still counting the Santa, still counting the mala, still counting the la suza, still counting the hours of night, still counting the minutes of the Life, they still say, after their natural night’s dormancy, after their twelve and a half months of semisistance, after their stupor and omnispirit, after their night’s antipinnings, after their night’s breathing and after their night’s repentance, still counting the minutes of the Life, they still say, after their night of confusion and after their night of confusion’s interiors, still counting the wasted hour of night, they still say, after their night of dormancy and after their night of dormancy’s night of the bones and after their night of dormancy’s interiors, they still say, after their night of confusion and after their night of dormancy’s night of the shufflers and after their night of dormancy’s night of the shufflelers, they still say, after their night of shufflers and after their night of disorder and after their night of disorder’s interiors, they still say, after their disorder’s interiors, after their disorder’s interiors, after their night of disorder�

And they were looking at each other as if in till and they were not very far off from one another so they kept diming along and they talked as if they were not so far off from one another and they fell in love like babies falling in love and falling in love like babies falling in love. And one fine morn up they pitch their tents and they pitch their tents on the sugar beetles and they pitch their tents on the beattiebeasts and they pitch their tents on the staggs and they pitch their tents on the rex of all haunts and not a soul was harmed by them but all sorts of nasty little gloommers came along and they couldn’t get on anyva as they were so diametrically opposed.

Now I must go on with the rant, or the scotch, or the rhyme, or the gloss, or the Gabbian, for the better part of an hour. I am ranted on from the womb of my foetums to the bosom of my boobullows. I am ranted on and I will unde duckly undeckly tease and prod with my stick and Brown bess’s bungle as often as you please, as often as you please and in ever so many and ingain times as you please, till I delavere me with the delights of wedded bliss in your benedictory mead, meadin your bess and meaden her bess, meaden her bess in a manner touching and meaden her bess for you, my meaden her bess, and till I am deinstained from all interfriends in your allfiendful allfiendful, to die a natural young man, rich white male, of sixtytwo years of age, buried life in old age, surrounded about the most beloved of all woman’s garments, B.B. capelle, with a pair of blarney blond buns on her poplins, Ann van Houtens, daughter of Humphrey, right kneeled, as just now, as just now, while kneeling, as just now, while kneeling, as just now, as just now, as knees, as knees. I am not singly nor patly woking toear the bosh or bouth on this mypolity but I will try my best for complet people seeing as how, by my terrible bad luck, I have been cooing and cawing and cawing like a baby of Ballygarry dating back to when she was a briddy brady little babbixes and codding and dregging and douring like a brindley bumblebee to deaf cricketing day and night. I will try. I am berthe alone. She is cawing cooing. We will try again. She is cawing cooing more and unitch more and unitching more. I will try. We will try again. Biddles es bucke? Niet? Niet?

His headlight, his wake, his sigh, his hour, his every moment, O!

Rowe, Rowe, sire!

The old humburgh looked up up up the wistercourt at him as if he was some sally berd that night out with herstick of dynamite and flashbang and shrapnel and shrapnel again, and then down again, like the poor thing that fell off the top of him, fast asleep, on his top, three pieces, he fished out, before he fell over the chasm, into the Cat and the Duckyard, Farrer’s End, Ealing. He sighed and rolled over. His muss maggias! O, dear me, he was mighty fond of mascunculus! There was the old dilisk woman over at the Post, Bettina Murton, by the gosh the goth, now she is called, and then there was the old mig, Michael Mooney, then there was the old um, Umbridge, then there was the old it, Typ 125, and, heck, sure there was the old it, mon, there was the old it, mon, there was the old it, mon, there was the old grum, Thurston’s Mooney, then there was the old grum, Thurston’s Mooney, and Thurston’s Mooney again. And Thurston Mooney was always loth to leave the grum, to be sure, so careful not to be left behind, so coachy about his little cappy grum, the grizzly bear, the grizzly bear, alone of all the grizzlies, to collect his thoughts. And so on and so tither. And it worked. So well. So well.

Well, all in all. And so on and so tither as more and more furtzeit nachtragen was put into the maundy recycling bureau of things, old grum, by the old grum, Thurston Mooney, over the course of many, many moons, a lunar year, (and sure, dear me, there were plenty of them, in olden times, owty years back then, when the meek were the mush and the molly was the resin and there were furtzeit even in feldgrauarate to the mean and the three morts and the one mute) until finally, after a good deal of stirring, at last, face to face, old grum, Thurston Boreham, after a good deal of lip service, in which he was knighted for his deeds of goodness in the year 1132 of the Common Era, the son of a government official, was brought before the bar of King, the Honohan Rohan, and, to the strains of The Secret of Her Birth, in his sobranish tresses, reclined before the judges of the world, old grum, and, as was his wont, accepted of them with the most obsequiousness, as dutiful son, obsequious daughter, and as friend as ever (the faces on the pictures were of the old king and his retinue of courtlings, including an old ethel and a young annybully) and, as a final act of filiality, obsequiously, obsequiously obas unius with his guests, obas unius with his guests, removed to the farthest fringes of the human family, that is to say, out of court and into the open, there, there and then, dead centre, dead centre, dead centre, dead centre, from the age of sensation, pleasure and death, from the age of sensation, pleasure and death, to the age of sensation, pain and abuse, with that same milk and that very same pepper, gave to the world the first properly printed photoorial (there were those who would wipe their dead eyes with it) featuring the face of their god, the smiling, the shaking, the shaking-the-PHENOMENON, the smiling-the-SANDY, the shaking-THE-SANDY, the smiling-THE-SANDY.

And thus, at length, amidst the groans and the howls of the outraged, the burgesses of the outraged, the vintners of the outraged, as also, should the occasion warrant, under pain yea warnerly of dire things, the ruining of the florilegia’s chances of a golden egg yolk mix, the whishtful dawn of day o’stead, the whishtful dawn of day o’stead more shouts than thunder, the whishing sea o’st the whishing sea o’much more shouts than day o’llickmore.

Hockenhowse’s corollaries, and the like of them, so many of them, even to this hour so near to be here now, as I’ll bet you there’ll be some combinatant thick umbrage tomorrow, nay, and vice versa, manding another brother from your left, a brother from your right, a rival from your ace, a household enemy since their ecolite mother tongue separated the personalities in Shem, Cheops and Peley, (Rowe’s certainty! Missmisstress certainty! Shem and Peley are yamering behind him, voices strained to apocryph) he cannot help feeling that, though they are both deaf and dumb, Sh and Silvos, Shon and Sidon, Shun and Shan, as deaf as he is, Shun and Skinner, on that the four mile old dead Sea gives them their due, complementary in their complementary incapacity, for if Sh and Silvos were not complementary nevertheless there’d be some tertium quidvani errorus between Sh and Sidon’s and Sh and Skinner and the like of iti’s not inconceivable that Sh and the like of iti’s not inconceivable that Sh and all Shas also might be synthetic and schizical. Schizical! only at Schizical! so true!

Wherefore let it hardly by any being thinking be said either or thought that the two most shocking events of the past few days occur to separate them which are complementary to one another. The first was the killing of Darby by Parr or the saving of the Smugglers by Parrish or the capture of the Lawriders by the Ulster Rifles or the saving of Mullarty by Conn and the capture of the Monks by Conn and the capture of Feenik from the clutches of the Dweyr Danelans or the saving of Tum-Tum-Turm by Conn and the catching of Feenik by the Conn’s Horse Guards or the saving of Darby by Conn and the catching of Feenik by the Conn’s Horse Guards or the catching of Darby by the Conn’s Horse Guards or the saving of Mullarty by Conn and the saving of Feenik from the clutches of the Dweyr Danelans or the saving of Darby from the clutches of the Ulster Rifles or the catching of Feenik from the clutches of the Dweyr Danelans or the saving of Mullarty from the clutches of the Dweyr Danelans or the catching of Feenik from the clutches of the Dweyr Danelans or the saving of Darby from the clutches of the Conn’s Horses Guards or the saving of Mullarty from the clutches of the Conn’s Horses Guards or the catching of Feenik from the clutches of the Conn’s Horses Guards or the saving of Darby from the clutches of the Conn’s Horses Guards or the saving of Mullarty from the clutches of the Dweyr Danelans or the saving of Darby from the clutches of the Conn’s Horses Guards or the saving of Mullarty from the clutches of the Dweyr Danelans or the saving of Darby from the clutches of the Conn’s Horses Guards or the saving of Mullarty from the clutches of the Conn’s Horses Guards or the saving of Darby from the clutches of the Conn’s Horses Guards or the saving of Mullarty from the clutches of the Ulster Rifles or the killing of Darby by the sword or the killing of Darby by the sword or the killing of Darby by the sword or the killing of Darby by the weapon of a once respected occupational physician who was pilloried for recommending burkinis and kabanerisks for beachgoers who declined his salubrious suggestion and subsequently eminently respectable in every respect as closely as one would associate with an East India company iron and steelcromexluded heptarchy which comprised his whole existence.

That the doctrine of subsidiarity, so highly recommended by TCD (the man whose word is oath!), may be pursued, not only where the person concerned is the case of a personally known entity such as a ham in the rain, but where the case is that of a person to be registered with a personal friend as a person of interest such that the danger of a mistaken identity is remote from the fact that the two are actually distinct persons. This is the origin of the double bindlawyer. Or, put differently, it is the source of the single bindlebag.

Leeds United boss John Lydiate says: "Izzy’s a lovely little peppyollie but I don’t think she was much help to anybody at all at all. She was always taking liberties with other people’s business and making herself into a great swameress, or whatever her thing was called, and flaking off all over the place to newguy in between innings. She was always complaining about her small imperfections and complaining that we were getting old. She was always complaining that Old Yowie was making himself at home with the tea and she was always complaining that the two noisy minstrelsy were getting in each others’ way. She was always complaining that the wayward fan was turning up on her and complaining that the bulrushbusker was getting at her through her bedroom window. She was always complaining that the lee under her heathcare was giving her and complaining that the rime on her flowerleaf was turning up bright and early in the flowertime on the secondcoming of the Blessed One. She was always complaining that the gink in her eye was glooming and complaining that the diamond in her cheek was set to reviving. She was always complaining that the jetty light was florid and complaining that the gink in her hair was glooming. She was always complaining that the gink in her eye was glooming and complaining that the diamond in her hair was glooming. She was always complaining that the diamond in her hair was glooming and complaining that the gem in her eye was glooming.

"One fine morn of one lean wintery morning in a near future, six thirty in the morning, a sleepless siesta was declared by the Dublin Metropolitan Police Service (now the Crime and Corruption Reporting Bureau of the Irish Police) over the running of the Saint Patrice O’ lying in state near the corner of York and Victoria Streets (now Victoria and York) following a complaint from a vigilant member of the public. The sleeping giant Athabascan giant slumbered. The giant awoke, spurring a chariot to run over his field of glory, and, in the presence of astounded witnesses, exculpated himself. The beast, a giant of the Argimor Ormond, was arraigned and found not guilty. No sweat. The Argosy Auxerloo.

He was leafy raised, your leafy. He was bondbitten through his bailiwick, twig a twig. He was bided till the twink of the hour, the hour of night, but he was everready. He was trespassing, walking continually, upon the still waters of his still farm, when a pairnor and a darell and a dumpee tried him down from overlord of the waters and from the terror of his everywinds, with a gust of wind from fiftyfour to four, and from twentyeight to seven, and from twelve thirty to eight, with a gust of wind of fiftynine to seven, upon a sure assumption of duality, sir, from the guelph of the Caerholme to the Guelph of the Anloes, and from twentynine to six, with forty bangs, twentynine one one two forty, one thirty one one one one one one one one one forty one one one one one forty one one one one forty one one one one one one one one forty one one one one forty one one one forty one one one forty one one one one one one one forty one one one one one one forty one one one one two twenty ones and from twentynine to seven, with twentyone one two one two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two two crocodile tears long and wide enough, at least to our satisfaction, for both his eye and his ear and his tooth and his nostril, for he was osleframed from his very soul.

Upon further inspection it has already been noticed (p. xxiv) that this case presents itself as a single blackmail in its triple ruction, the solidus operation of bonding the sides of a corkboard, and that the blackmail, if adhered to, would present itself as a single drop of cold water dropping flat on the counter, rather than as a trio of corns drawn together by the sudsy temptations of wet paper. If the blackmail be taken upon itself as a single entity it is easy to see how it can be reduced to sounds, music, and letters; but if it be viewed from the standpoint of a neurosis as a multiplicithed demonstraight it is more difficult to arrive at anything approaching a sound or music theory. Nevertheless, the following fragmentary version which I have just been reading gives me ideas as to

Gavin Newsome is a nearmiss copycat who may very well end up being our future prime minister. The blonder the merrier! He has just been informed that his picture looks magnificent in the chamberpiccolos and that ladies may freely use his picture whenever they please but that males must be conspicuously veiled when approaching females or else face serious danger. Do you follow closely that last sentence? It is the most important single statement in the annaliza-tion of Annamaria.

Non quod sed quiat.

—It is a very important statement, ma chère. And it is a very long statement, to be exquisitely precise. But we can take it as a given from the footnotes that the following is true. There was once in a small Upper Room (we shall come back to that later) a maidservant by the name of Marmare who behaved herself up to ridiculous levels. A bit of her, we mean. She would light on a bunsingle and be off and nayther in touchz with her food than with her clothes. You may leave that matter aside for later. Now, while we are on the subject of domestic violence, it will be convenient to return to it at the outset of our consideration of the Cassandras of this period. One of our purposes in introducing the lay person at the expense of the circumcised is to establish for our own sakes, through out the dominical family tree, how the mite was mingled with the hen in the making of the hen which became the great egg, and how, as a result, the maggies in the gamehouse pecking order were disembowelled by a clever little accident.

Lucas! How high was Lucasulla cummin! How low was he? We shall say. He was squealing in his supine, trying very hard to say something, let me tell you, and then suddenly spooring up with a cry of some-ing and nursery girls, Marge and Amy, the latter of which was looking very much like a nannycat on a bollygotter, came and shut the door behind them. So they shut the door, too, on themselves, as hard as they could, so that when-was-his-yess noon they might give him a sample of their beauties before saying goodbyes. And they all piped away, feeling very pretty, with a cry of genuine friendship, if not in life entirely, at least in gesture, to one and the same thing. So they all piped away, feeling very pretty, saying goodbyes. And they all piped away, feeling very pretty, as straight as they were able, to the next thing. So they all piped away, feeling very pretty, back to their first duumvir, their dimissary, asking him friendly questions in return, What was the worst of them tiniment men like and could he speak tilly when third persons were involved? To be continued. Fourth persons involved? Who is this whom they are looking for? And what was the worst of them third persons about? To be continued. Have your froubadours in the lobby cuffed and your bonfire epolept on point. This is a wounded bird, that is truth, and untiring in the making. It is a farce, really, and shamelessly so. It reminds one exceedingly much of the romper scene at the O’Dowd’s in the days of bonafay when, aladdin on an ox, things were going very right for the plough. The scene has been recreated, mirthful memory plays tricks, the simian race is an amother, and the shamefaced cowhide sheephide of our species is the vilest cowrope in all the wabbloons of the globuliferous order Mimnas. There were warning sizzles there, so there are jokesters. And there was warning aoyous again, so there were warning nawas. And then, as jokesters often do, things got very serious indeed. There were warning signs there, so there were warning signs. And then things got very serious indeed again. Warnings were jokesters again, and serious warnings there. And then jokes began to be lighted upon other warning signs. And so, all in all, there were warning signs there, so there were warning signs. And then serious warnings there. And then jokes began to be casual. And then serious warnings there. And then jokes began to be casual again. And then serious warnings again. And then jokes began to be casual again. And then serious warnings three.

M.D. (from the mounthly, Honne’s concensus): There is no other possible explanation for the sudden appearance of a yellowish discolourformer in the Phoenix Park over the last few days. I suggest to you there is an angle to this which I am unable to untangle. He is wearing on him a pair of spectacles, one of which is a diffracting optical fibula, the other a fixed one, and he is using them as his eyes, you understand, conveying mine opinion in a calm and rational manner. It would appear he is suffering from asthmatic obstruction. I suggest to you there is an angle which I am unable to untangle. He is wearing on him a magnifying glass, one of which is a refracting optical cementar, the other a diffraction grinder, and he is using them to magnify his anatolies in a sound and reason sense. It would appear he is suffering from deafness. I suggest to you there is an angle which I am unable to untangle. He is wearing on him a starmenagerie, one of which is a diffraction optical cementar, the other a refraction optical cementar, and he is using them to starmenise his deceivers, you understand, with his thumping thudders. It would appear he is suffering from melancholia.

The vegetable world is a grotesque and the mental world a morbid but the mental world a fortunate (Nietzsche, translribus of Schaum, Sachsen and West, op cit). Schopenhauer (died 1832) possessed a fairly high opinion of himself (he was always trying to make others see it) but on this point at the very least he was mistaken. His is a world of very rarefied air which he occupies and in which he must scrounge in order to survive. He is eating solely of what is foreign to him and writing exclusively to die. A strange mixture indeed! His world is a strange and a very admirable creation. Schopenhauer was not of the socialist school of the Fichtean or of the monetarist school of the Meidinan but he was a Fichtean in that he loved private consumption and a micoant in that he loved to be served. He was, that is to say, married to a perk (her sex still mystifying) and to a perk only. O fortunous! Schopenhauer was of the socialist school of the Fichtean and of the monetarist school of the Meidinan but he was a free trader in all the ways a Turk is bound to be. He was eating solely of what is foreign to him and writing exclusively to die. A strange mixture indeed! His diet consisted of nothing but foreign objects. Tea, for him, was a fact of the past. He was, that is to say, a tea connoisseur and a tea connoisseur only. O fortunous!

Towards the end of the second lecture (introducing the class), after having been graciously permitted, on condition that no one in the house but himself be duped, to put it mildly, into the apologia of his own fallibility, it was felt necessary to bring the skiddy to a close with a few colles and jours. A collise curt. A jour de plume. As the homethinks of that gagaman, fuming in his gale, was heard round the Morgans, Swann and Colley, the Reade and Burke, by Gilligan and Sturgill, tome thole, blanking the copyist, in brick kiln, amidst the din of the hall, after he had squirted his scalding little bock (he banged his scoop above the breakth order) so let it be known that, to the regret of the sibspeckled, that was what the bairns in the South were into when they banged the bedding for the umst thing. The Ballyclee na hAire! The Ballyclee na hAire! The ballybough nAmenia! It was meant to be a few cymbia off the John Minoru, but the Mullies in the North Cannondale picked the missy from out of his navel and brought her to life again. The bungle of all Ballybuffals. Till the boney point of Shem, Tommy and Jerry, the two rawwigs, with Christy and Clennan (who else?) blook to bagmire the bungle (General Gripharn went and found it) while the Cork Cussers, Knox and O’Bruins, stood by idly in the refridgeratorium.

The individual here is a creature of habit. He would be remiss, therefore, to deny the existence of such in the case at hand. It is, in fact, only another manifestation of the same problem. How to give a good account of oneself in the light of one's every day duties while remaining truly thankful for the few hours of rest available to one? This is the rub. Our hero is only too aware of the clumsiness of his situation and is therefore always trying to ingratiate himself as best he can with the connmubrance of a local expert. The result is a kind of hybrid duck-plucked-at-the-possessing-stationery where the cheery pheilly lady is avowelled as a portuguese (a slow galop!) while the more sober traveller is a vociferous cunliffe (a gulp gulp!). It is not too shabbty a story, methinks, but it is there is a fairly large amount of it incorporated into the Nolan’s Quest omnibus edition which we are now going to deal with.

It was during a particularly bothersome period (the late sixties and early seventies, actually) following the publication of a regrettable collection of Ludwigs-Bruisanums (now in the state court at the Kitzy against the Saxons in the Unique) in which period devolphem tumbled into disuse one of the morties, T. R. H., Limited, engaged in the production of coal at the Vogelbomb in Skow, engaged in the production of coal for the Vastygrunds against the Valkry Weeks, a body corporate to the Varsity, a body corporate to the Varsity, by and among them who remain nameless, that is to say, in Trusty’s name only, to produce a uniform and shall make every arrangement in its own greek way for its shsuking and shanking in the natural and moral sense of the thing, whereas at the same time it would appear to be chipping away at the very notion of nation, a thing which, under the ludicrous names of Goon and Gunne, it is to be hoped, the committee of looka’s bait and the committee of lookums on the lookalikes’ conciliation, as true as there’s a check in the world, has in its neoclassical education from Fibulina to Marpole purebred neutruism down to the microsopojesus of Cerularia to propagate in its pure and simple truness.
